# Take-home Exercise - BI Analyst 

## Summary
At Accredible, you will be responsible for data models that cover use cases spanning across multiple teams, from go-to-market, to product, to finance. In this take-home exercise, we wanted to give you a small taste of what a day in the life of a BI Analyst at Accredible looks like whilst getting to know your skills and ways of working better. 

None of your work will be used by Accredible, the goal of this exercise is to showcase the way that you approach your work, and to build your understanding of our expectations in the role.

For this take home exercise, you will be working on a critical problem for our go-to-market team - the Sales Funnel. This data model should enable our key business stakeholders to understand how many deals have progressed through each stage of the sales cycle. In our case, weâ€™ll be focusing on a single pipeline which consists of six distinct stages:
1. Discovery
2. Qualified
3. Proof of Value
4. Proposal/Pricing
5. Procurement/Negotiation
6. Closed Won / Closed Lost

A single deal should move through these stages in a chronological order, but it can go from any stage to Closed Lost.
